1. Alternative Method of Public-Key Encryption

Pseudo Code 

Approach: The provided code implements an alternative method of public-key encryption. The public key consists of a list of integers 'h', while the private key consists of three integers 'e', 'q', and 'w'. To encrypt a message, the message is first converted into a sequence of bits. These bits are then split into blocks of size 'len(h)'. Each block is then encrypted by multiplying it, component-wise, with the corresponding elements of 'h'. The resulting encrypted blocks are then transmitted to the receiver. To decrypt the ciphertext, the receiver first computes the inverse of 'w' modulo 'q'. This inverse is then used to multiply each ciphertext block, modulo 'q'. The resulting products are then converted back into a sequence of bits, which is finally converted back into the original plaintext message.

Public Key Generation:
Generate a list 'e' of n random integers within a specified range.
Generate a random prime number 'q' greater than 2en.
Generate a random integer 'w' such that gcd(w, q) = 1.
Compute 'h' by multiplying corresponding elements of 'e' and 'w' modulo 'q'.
Public key = h, Private key = (e, q, w).

Encryption:
Convert plaintext to bit blocks of size len(h).
For each block, calculate the sum of corresponding elements of block and h modulo q.
Return list of encrypted blocks.

Decryption:
Compute w_inv = pow(w, -1, q).
For each encrypted block:
Calculate c_prime = block * w_inv modulo q.
Iterate through 'e' in reverse order:
If c_prime >= e_i, subtract e_i from c_prime and append 1 to 'bits'.
Else, append 0 to 'bits'.
Convert bits to plaintext by chunking into 8-bit characters.
Return plaintext.

Testing:
Two sets of public-private key pairs are generated for testing with n value of 16 and 32
Same text is given as input in both the cases. The text has over 500 characters. 

Observations: 
1.	16 and 32 random integers are generated respectively. Easy key has 16 and 32 integers with the property that each element is greater than the sum of the previous elements. 
2.	q and w generated are co-primes. 
3.	Public key, h, has 16 and 32 integers respectively, generated with the property hi = (wùëíùëñ mod q)
4.	Ciphertext is generated with public key. 
5.	The decryption code has worked successfully and regenerated the original plaintext message.

Firewall rules conflict:

‚Ä¢ Issue- During addition rules. ‚Äòadd_rule‚Äô method adds a new rule without checking the 
existing rule.

‚Ä¢ When a new rule overlaps an existing rule, there are possibilities of rule conflicts.

Possible Solution:

‚Ä¢ Add calidation mechanism in ‚Äòadd_rule‚Äô method.

‚Ä¢ Check for existing rules and directions prior to adding any new rule.
